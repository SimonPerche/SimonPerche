## Main projects

|Projects|Description|Demonstration|
|---|---|---|
|[My shadertoy profile](https://www.shadertoy.com/user/sperche)| Test project using ray marching algorithm|![](readme_files/shader_toy_black_hole.gif)
|[Augmented reality from scratch](https://github.com/SimonPerche/AugmentedRealityFromScratch)| An augmented reality application from scratch using OpenCV (C++) for learning purpose. It works by recognizing the ARTag on the image, deducing the camera's position and projecting user objects onto the tag. Developed with [Nicolas LÃ©py](https://github.com/nicolasLepy).|![](readme_files/ARFS.gif)|
| [Plague Simulator](https://github.com/PlathC/PlagueSimulator) | Learning project which aims to simulate the evolution of a disease inside a defined population using Multi Agent system in Unity. Developed with [Cyprien Plateau--Holleville](https://github.com/PlathC). |![](readme_files/plague_simulator.png)|
|[Holodraw](https://github.com/enzo-bonnot/ARDrawing)|A drawing application using augmented reality technology with Microsoft Hololens and Unity Engine. Developed with [Enzo Bonnot](https://github.com/enzo-bonnot).|![](readme_files/holodraw.gif)
