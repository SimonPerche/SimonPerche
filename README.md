|[Augmented reality from scratch](https://github.com/SimonPerche/AugmentedRealityFromScratch)| An augmented reality application from scratch using OpenCV (C++) for learning purpose. It works by recognizing the ARTag on the image, deducing the camera's position and projecting user objects onto the tag. This project was developed with [Nicolas LÃ©py](https://github.com/nicolasLepy).|![](readme_files/ARFS.png)|

Developed with [Cyprien Plateau--Holleville](https://github.com/PlathC). |![](readme_files/plague_simulator.png)|
